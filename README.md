# About the NTR Policy

This **NTR Policy** was set up by [vzaar](http://vzaar.com) after doing several rounds of recruitment where we found the overhead from dealing with recruiters and recruiting agencies exceeded our capacity as a team to manage the process effectively.

This mainly stems from two issues

* Recruiters phone a lot, tech companies work better by email
* There are too many recruiters to effectively manage
 
A better process was needed and drawing heavy inspiration from [Shutl: Note to Recruiters](http://shutl.com/note-to-recruiters) and [Moo: Hello Recruiters](http://uk.moo.com/about/recruiters.html) we created this policy.

Since this may be use to other companies out there we've open sourced it. Feel free to use this text verbatim, or altered as you like to suit your business.

Please fork it, change it. Also if you feel there are changes that would benefit the source material, put in a pull request.

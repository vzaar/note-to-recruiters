# Recruiter activities that increase workload and add no value include

* Cold calling and explaining why you’re different. You’re not. I’ve heard the same pitch from 2 dozen other recruiters. 
* Not looking at our website/business and expecting us to explain what we do
* Not reading the job descriptions
* Sending contractors for permanent roles and visa versa 
* Sending candidates with completely different tech skills than the role calls for (e.g. .net candidates for ruby roles)
